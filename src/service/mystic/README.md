# Mystic

With the recent interest in diary-keeping, the capstone project team '아니 근데 오늘 진짜' has implemented a model that uses LLM to automatically generate a diary through conversations about the events of the day. Mystic is a project that uses STT and TTS technology to talk to LLM to generate a diary.
